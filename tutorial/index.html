                    <H3>WHAT IS TEAMILY?</H3>
<p class="lead">Teamily is a fresh new way of working for teams which is quickly being adopted all over the world. More than 500 teams worldwide are now working the Teamily way, and the numbers are growing quickly. Teamily is especially designed for teams that want to work on impactful, creative and purpose driven projects. Independent of the project a team is working on, Teamily makes sure that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a strong and committed team</li>
<li>Create something surprising that you did not expect to create</li>
<li>Generate results that are fulfilling</li>
<li>Develop your team skills in the process</li>
</ul>

<h3>WHAT MAKES TEAMILY UNIQUE?</h3>
<p class="lead">
We make use of modern technology to help teams work better. Whereas in the past a book would be the only way to guide teams, now we can use software. Through the use of the Teamily app we are right there with the team helping you in your projects. The Teamily app is easy to use and acts as a guide and coach for the team. It makes sure every team is well informed and stays on track to success. This is what sets Teamily apart from other methods.
</p>

<h3>THE TEAMILY PRINCIPLES:</h3>
<p class="lead">
Teamily works if the team follows a certain set of principles. We have developed these principles the hard way. Years of research and a countless amount of projects have resulted in this list of principles. We have made these principles, so you don’t need to make the mistakes many have made before you.</p>

<h3>The principles</h3>
<ul>
<li>No problem=no team: Teams are set-up around the need to solve a problem</li>
<li>A project always has 16 stages.</li>
<li>Drivers don’t get picked, drivers step up.</li>
<li>Every stage of the project deserves the best driver</li>
<li>After every stage of a project the project is driverless</li>
<li>People can always step in and out of teams</li>
<li>Never skip a stage, even if the stage looks obvious and easy.</li>
</li>
</ul>

                    <H3>PREPARE</H3>
<p class="lead">Any new way of working requires some adjustments from the team. Don't be afraid if it feels a bit uncomfortable at the beginning. Once you get a project going you will quickly get a feel of how things work and see results.</p>
<p class="lead">
Before you assemble a team, try to describe the problem you want to work on. Bring the problem down to a short clear defined statement. People relate to problems. People don’t relate to solutions. If you want to assemble a strong committed team that does not act opportunistic or is predominantly involved with their own personal gain, than connect people around a shared problem. This ensures long term commitment and enables people to go above and beyond what they normally would do.</p>

<h3>START A PROJECT</h3>
<p class="lead">
Once you know what the problem is, you need a team to solve it. Time to invite them. Go to back to <a href="https://www.teamily.com" target="_blank" style="color:white">teamily.com</a> and start a new project, fill in your problem and invite members.
</p>

<h3>PROJECT STATUS</h3>
<p class="lead">
The Project Status is the home of your project. On this page you always see who is driving the project currently and in which stage the project is. Further by clicking around on the diagram you can go back to previous stages or see what future stages are about.</p>

                    <H3>BECOME THE DRIVER</H3>
<p class="lead">Drivers are the leaders of every stage of a project. Before a new stage starts the team needs to find its driver. The only way the team can have a driver is by someone of the team claiming the role. A driver can not be appointed.</p>

<p class="lead">It is the driver’s responsibility to bring the project to the end of this stage. In every stage the driver is responsible for something that is created and accepted by the team/market. The object of creation can be a vision, a contract, a plan or a result. It all depends on the stage of the project.</p> 

<p class="lead">If your project does not have a driver for a stage with more than 50% we encourage you to invite someone extra to the team for this stage.</p>

<h3>YOUR PERSONAL DRIVER ROLES</h3>
<p class="lead">
Every team member has a Teamily profile. In the Teamily profile team members can see which driver roles fit them naturally. All driver roles with a score of 75% or 100% will feel comfortable to take on. Roles that score lower might feel uncomfortable and require some effort to perform.</p>
<p class="lead">
Clicking on the 'Claim Driver Role' button instantly makes you the driver of that stage of the project. Don’t worry, it sounds scarier than it actually is.</p>
<p class="lead">
<i> Tip: Driver fear in your team is very common, breaking through this will speed up your project. Trust us! Click the button and become the driver. Be a hero!</i></p>

                    <H3>OPENING AND CLOSING OF STAGES</H3>
<p class="lead">Every project consists of 16 sequential stages. Every stage of a project has it’s own purpose. In every stage something needs to be created under the responsibility of the driver. Also every stage has a clear result. Once the result is achieved the stage can only be closed by the driver. In this way any project can be successful by completing these stages in this order. </p>

<p class="lead">
It might feel a bit uncomfortable to follow these steps in the beginning, all teams experience this. Just keep going and open and close the stages.  Success is getting closer.</p>
